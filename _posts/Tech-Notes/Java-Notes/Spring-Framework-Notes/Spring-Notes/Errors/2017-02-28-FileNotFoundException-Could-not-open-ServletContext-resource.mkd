## Details

`
FileNotFoundException: Could not open ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/views/api/projects/4/applications/students/4.html]
`
## Reason

`@ResponseBody` is forgotten to add, which makes `Spring` resolve it as `/WEB-INF/views/api/projects/4/applications/students/4.html`.
## Solution

Add `@ResponseBody` before `@RequestMapping`.
