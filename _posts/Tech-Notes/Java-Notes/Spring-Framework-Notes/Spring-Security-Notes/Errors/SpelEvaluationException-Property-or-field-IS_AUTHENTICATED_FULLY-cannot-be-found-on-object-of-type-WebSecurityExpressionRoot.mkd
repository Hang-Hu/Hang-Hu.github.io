#SpelEvaluationException : Property or field 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY' cannot be found on object of type WebSecurityExpressionRoot
##Reason
`<http>` element has an attribute `use-expressions` which is `true` by default. In the default situation, you are required to use "security expressions" instead of role names. If you wish to use only role names in access= declarations, you need to turn off expressions with
```
<http use-expressions="false"> ... </http>
```
##Solution
Change `IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY` to  `isFullyAuthenticated()`.
