#Updating war in tomcat has no effect
##Reason
I moved war to ArchitectureLab folder, which is wrong because tomcat only scan war in webapps and deploy it automatically.
```
mv ArchitectureLab.war /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.37/webapps/ArchitectureLab/
```
##Solution
Move war to webapps instead.
```
mv ArchitectureLab.war /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.37/webapps/

```
