## Reason

The default location of `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` is `/etc/hadoop/conf`, but I've downloaded hadoop directly from website, making the config file inside hadoop file, which is `/usr/local/hadoop-2.6.0/etc/hadoop/`.

## Solution

```
vim hadoop-env.sh
```


Add this line


```
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/usr/local/hadoop-2.6.0/etc/hadoop/
```


I think set `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` in `/etc/profile` will also solve it.
