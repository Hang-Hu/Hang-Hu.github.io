## Reason

`BufferedWriter` will only write when it's full, to be closed or flushed.

## Solution

Use `writer.close()` or `writer.flush()` if you don't want to close it.

```
writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(new File("text.txt")));
writer.write(stringBuilder.toString());
writer.close();
```
