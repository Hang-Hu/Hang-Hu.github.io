#Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError

It's possible that original recursion length is right but something gets wrong in code to make the infinite recursion.  

I use left==right as return condition.  
However, when at last only two number, then the two quickSort will gives out one left==right and one left>right.  
So change the condition of return to left>=right will solve it.
