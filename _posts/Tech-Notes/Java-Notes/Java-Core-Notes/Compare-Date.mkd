#Compare Date
>Date has before and after methods and can be compared to each other as follows:
```
if(todayDate.after(historyDate) && todayDate.before(futureDate)) {
    // In between
}
```
For an inclusive comparison:
```
if(!historyDate.after(todayDate) && !futureDate.before(todayDate)) {
    /* historyDate <= todayDate <= futureDate */ 
}
```
