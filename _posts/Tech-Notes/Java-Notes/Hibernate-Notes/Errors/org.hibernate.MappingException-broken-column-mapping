#org.hibernate.MappingException: broken column mapping
##Details
org.hibernate.MappingException: broken column mapping for: fileByFile.id of: com.general.dao.entity.FinalFileEntityPK
##Reason
Only in case of many to many, a new table using composite key is needed. Therefore, Hibernate don't allow `one-to-one` relationship for property in `composite key`.
##Solution
Change it from `one-to-one` to `many-to-one` or `one-to-many`.  
Or maybe you need `inheritance` relationship, which means no composite key and uses one property as id.
So I change primary key from `(file, team)` to `file`.
