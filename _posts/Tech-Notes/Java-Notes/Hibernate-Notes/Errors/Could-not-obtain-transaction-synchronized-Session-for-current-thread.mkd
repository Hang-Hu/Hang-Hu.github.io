#org.hibernate.HibernateException: Could not obtain transaction-synchronized Session for current thread
##Reason
Transaction support is not enabled yet.
##Solution
###Spring Configuration
1. `<tx:annotation-driven>` in `springmvc.xml` or `@EnableTransactionManagement` in `AppConfig`
2. Declare the transactionManager, don't forget to give a sessionFactory to it.
###Dao Annotation
Add `@Transactional` along with `@Repository` for such Class as `UserDaoImpl`.
