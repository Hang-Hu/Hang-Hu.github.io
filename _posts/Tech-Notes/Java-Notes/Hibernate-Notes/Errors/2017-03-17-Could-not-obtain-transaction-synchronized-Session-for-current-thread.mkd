## Reason

Transaction support is not enabled yet.
## Solution

### Spring Configuration

1. `<tx:annotation-driven>` in `springmvc.xml` or `@EnableTransactionManagement` in `AppConfig`
2. Declare the transactionManager, don't forget to give a sessionFactory to it.
### Dao Annotation

Add `@Transactional` along with `@Repository` for such Class as `UserDaoImpl`.
