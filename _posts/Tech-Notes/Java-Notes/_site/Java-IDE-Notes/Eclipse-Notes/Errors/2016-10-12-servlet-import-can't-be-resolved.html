<p>Solution:</p>

<p>***** When you create a new Dynamic Web Project, you should select the integrated server from the list as Targeted Runtime in the 1st wizard step.</p>

<p>***** Or when you have an existing Dynamic Web Project, you can set/change it in Targeted Runtimes entry in projectâ€™s properties. Eclipse will then automagically add all its libraries to the build path (without having a copy of them in the project!).</p>
