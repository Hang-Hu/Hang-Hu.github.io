<h2 id="reason">Reason</h2>

<p>This or a similar warning is emitted by a plugin that processes plain text files but has not been configured to use a specific file encoding. So eliminating the warning is simply a matter of finding out which plugin emits it and how to configure the file encoding for it.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>This is as easy as adding the following property to your POM between existing project(or one of its parent POMs):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;project&gt;
  ...
  &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
  ...
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
