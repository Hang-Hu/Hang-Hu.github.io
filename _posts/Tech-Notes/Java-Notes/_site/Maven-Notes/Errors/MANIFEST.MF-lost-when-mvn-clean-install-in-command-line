#target/m2e-wtp/web-resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF (No such file or directory)
##Reason
manifest.mf is getting destroyed when we try to do maven build using mvn clean install. If we don't want to destroy manifest.mf file, just enter the command mvn install in the command prompt.

And if we missed the manifest.mf file, we can generate by uncheck & check the "Maven archiver generates files under the build directory" option in maven - JAVA EE integration as you said.

##Solution
Preferences > Maven > Java EE Integration and uncheck "Maven Archiver generates files under the build directory".
