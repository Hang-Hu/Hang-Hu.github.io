## Dropbox

No spped at all.

## Dukto

Small files only, stop when switch to other programs.

## Google Drive

Too slow.

## Nutstore

Once worked, but no speed now.

## Email

Faster, able to send 60M in 5 minites from 163 to 126 using Wangyi's client. However, each file is limited to 50 MB and I can't open thunderbird client.

## Wire(Recommend)

Most reliable and fast way, able to send files in seconds.
