#mkmf.rb can't find header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h
##Reason
```
The first link youâ€™ve posted is exactly your case: there is no ruby development environment installed. Development env is needed to compile ruby extensions, which are mostly written in C. Proxy has nothing to do with the problem: everything is downloaded fine, just compilation fails.

```
##Solution
```
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
```
