## Display of title

1. Every title must have one line before and one line after
2. Every title must have one space between `# ` and `Something`

3. Category should be lowercased otherwise centrarium won't find URL for it because URL uses lowercase.
4. More than one categories can be used but better not, otherwise it's meaningless to distinguish tags from category.

## Command

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
