#Move folders to overwrite another folder with the same name
Though its man page doesn't document it, mv will refuse to rename a directory to another directory if the target directory contains files. This is a good thing in your case because you turn out to want to merge the content of the source into the target, which mv will not do.
```
rm -rf /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.37/webapps/ROOT/teacher/team/
mv  team/ /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.37/webapps/ROOT/teacher/
```
