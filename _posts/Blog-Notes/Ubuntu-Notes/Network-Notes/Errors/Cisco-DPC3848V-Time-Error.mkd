## Check

A laptop cannot connect to network, after investigation it's due to access restriction based on time. The time in status is a wrong time and a time that was set to be blocked.

Go to Setup -> LAN Setup, check time zone, and disable NTP, then save. Turn off access restriction based on time and on, then network is back. Maybe it's time server error.

Check time server by `sntp time.nist.gov` or in https://servertest.online/ntp.
