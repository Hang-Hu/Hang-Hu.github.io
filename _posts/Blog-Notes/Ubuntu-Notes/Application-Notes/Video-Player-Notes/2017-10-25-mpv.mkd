## Play music

```
mpv *.mp4 --no-video --keep-open=no
```


Note that `--loop` is no longer used, and `--keep-open=no` is used instead to loop the playlist, `--loop-file` to loop playlist entries.


## Shuffle


```
--shuffle
```


## Play all in the directory


```
mpv ./* --shuffle --keep-open=no --no-video
```
