Local Extension Settings
Local Storage
```


For most extensions, copy the backed `Local Extension Settings` is enough to restore settings.


However, for extensions as `Block site`, you have to copy corresponding files in `Local Storage`.


Search these files using extension ID `eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh`
