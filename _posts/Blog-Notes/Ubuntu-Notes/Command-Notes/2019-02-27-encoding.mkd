## Find encoding of file

```
$ file -bi ans.txt 
text/plain; charset=utf-8
```


## Change encoding: iconv


```
$ iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii ans.txt > ans-ascii.txt
```


```
$ file -bi ans-ascii.txt 
text/plain; charset=us-ascii
```


### Error of iconv


```
iconv: illegal input sequence at position 149
```


Because there is a special character `â€™` as single quote, replace it with `'`.
