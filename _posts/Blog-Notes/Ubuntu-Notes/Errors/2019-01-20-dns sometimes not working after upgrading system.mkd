## Reason

I installed dns software and point all dns request to 127.0.0.1. During upgrading system, this software was deleted. Then there is nothing to resolve dns.

## Solution

```
sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
```


Change `127.0.0.1` to `8.8.8.8`.


```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```


```
sudo service network-manager restart
```
