## Details

Depends: nautilus-data (<1:3.19) but 1:3.26.4-0~ubuntu18.04.2 is to be installed

## Reason

The version of nautilus-data doesn't meet the requirement for nautilus.

## Solution

Delete the newer version of nautilus-data, install nautilus along with old version nautilus-data.

```
sudo apt remove nautilus-data
sudo apt install nautilus
```
