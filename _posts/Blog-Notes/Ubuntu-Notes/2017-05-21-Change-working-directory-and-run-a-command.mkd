## Method 1

```
cd /home/joanna/Documents/Notes/Tech-Notes/; retext
```

Error `Failed to execute child process "cd" (No such file or directory)` appears because cd is a shell builtin. Write it in a '.sh' file will work.


## Method 2


```
gnome-terminal --working-directory=/home/joanna/Documents/Notes/Tech-Notes/ -e 'retext'
```
