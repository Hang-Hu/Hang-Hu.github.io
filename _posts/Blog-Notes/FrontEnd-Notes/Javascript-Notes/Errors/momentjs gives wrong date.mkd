## Details

My date is 2019-04-06, which is stored in MongoDB as "2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z". However, after using momentjs as `moment(this.props.date).format("LL")`, it shows April 5, 2019.

## Reason

Moment js displays using local time, when `2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z` parsed to local time, it's `April 5, 2019`.

## Solution

Use `utc()`.

```
moment(this.props.date).utc().format("LL")
```
