## Reason

The import setting caused this.

## Solution

1. The idea in `Search Windows` is 32 bit idea, you have to go to `C:\Program Files\ideaIU-2017.1.5.win\bin\idea64.exe` to open the 64 bit idea.

2. Delete `C:\Users\hanhu\.IntelliJIdea2017.1` then restart idea.

3. Choose not import setting.

4. Re index the project.
