### Reason  

I never build any class for com.huhang.servlet.ServletDemo1, of course can't find this class.
### Solution

I am not sure which one or ones worked.  
Right click project, and choose "Build Project".  
Right click Tomcat in "Server" section, choose "Clean"  
Right click Tomcat in "Server" section, choose "Publish"
