## Reason

1. winutils.exe is required in windows to execute hadoop.

2. `HADOOP_HOME` and `PATH` are not set properly.

## Solution

1. Download hadoop-common-2.2.0-bin-master
2. Put its files into C:\Users\hanhu\Downloads\hadoop-2.6.5\bin
3. Set environment variables in windows. HADOOP_HOME C:\Users\hanhu\Downloads\hadoop-2.6.5. Then add `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin` to PATH
