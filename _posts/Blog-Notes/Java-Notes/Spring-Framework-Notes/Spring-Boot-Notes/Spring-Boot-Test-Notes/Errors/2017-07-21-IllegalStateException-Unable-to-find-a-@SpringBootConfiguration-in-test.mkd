## Reason

Unit test will search the class containing `@SpringBootApplication` and load this class as application context.

> The search algorithm works up from the package that contains the test until it finds a @SpringBootApplication or @SpringBootConfiguration annotated class. As long as youâ€™ve structure your code in a sensible way your main configuration is usually found.

## Solution

Use `@SpringBootApplication` instead of:

```
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
```
