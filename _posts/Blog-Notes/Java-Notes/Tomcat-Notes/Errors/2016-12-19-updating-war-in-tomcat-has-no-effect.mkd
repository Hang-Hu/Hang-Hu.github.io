## Reason

I moved war to ArchitectureLab folder, which is wrong because tomcat only scan war in webapps and deploy it automatically.

```
mv ArchitectureLab.war /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.37/webapps/ArchitectureLab/
```

## Solution

Move war to webapps instead.

```
mv ArchitectureLab.war /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.37/webapps/

```
