#org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role, could not initialize proxy - no Session
##Reason
By default hibernate lazily load collections and when you use it in controller which has no `@Transactional`, hibernate's loading will fail. 
##Solution1-Prolong JPA session
Add this to web.xml
```
<filter>
    <filter-name>SpringOpenEntityManagerInViewFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>SpringOpenEntityManagerInViewFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```
This code is used to `"to allow for lazy loading in web views despite the original transactions already being completed"`, this way you can use collections in jsp or controllers.  
However, lots of disadvantages is reported, don't do like this.
##Solution2-Best one, do bussiness in service layer
No bussiness logic in controller and move this code to service layer.
