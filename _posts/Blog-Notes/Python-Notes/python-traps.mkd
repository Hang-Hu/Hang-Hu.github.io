# Priority

`and` in python has higher priority than `==`, it stands for both `&&` and `&`.

The following is wrong, must use parenthesis for each component if `and` used.

```
wikipedia = wikipedia.filter(wikipedia.language == 'en'
                           & (wikipedia.title != 'Main_Page')
                           & (~wikipedia.title.startswith('Special:'))
                         )
```
