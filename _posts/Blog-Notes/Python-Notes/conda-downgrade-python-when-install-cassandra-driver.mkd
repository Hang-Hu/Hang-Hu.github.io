## details

I installed cassandra driver with this command, leading conda downgrade python 3.6 to 3.5 along with all packages relying on it.

```
conda install -c conda-forge cassandra-driver 
```

## Solution

Upgrade python and packages back to 3.6.

```
conda install python=3.6
```

Install cassandra-driver with pip3.6 of python3.6.

```
/home/joanna/anaconda3/bin/pip3.6 install cassandra-driver
```
