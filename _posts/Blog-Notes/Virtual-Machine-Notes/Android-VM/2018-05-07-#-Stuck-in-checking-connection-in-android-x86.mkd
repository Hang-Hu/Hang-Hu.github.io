## Reason

Network is ok in this android but google is banned in CN, causing the checking connection to persist.

`Alt+F1` enter command line, `Alt+F7` enter GUI.

`ping 8.8.8.8` or `ping baidu.com` are ok. `ping google.com` won't work.

## Solution

Turn off network to avoid that, right click on `Network Adapter` in vmware or virtual box, then click disconnect.
