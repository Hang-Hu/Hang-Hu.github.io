## Use underline

Note that normal space cannot be underlined.

1. Insert -> Special Characters, search PUNCTUATION SPACE, click PUNCTUATION SPACE(U+2008).
2. Select inserted white spaces and word, click Underline or use `Ctrl+u`.
3. I can copy and paste to get more these PUNCTUATION SPACE that can be underlined.
